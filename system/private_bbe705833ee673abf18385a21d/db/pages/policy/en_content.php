<h1>Shipping policy</h1>
<p>We send parcels to your local PO where postmen deliver them to the address you indicated in your order list.  If you are not at home at the moment of delivery, a postman leaves a special notice.</p>
<p>There are two ways of shipping:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Airmail. The delivery by  means of airmail lasts 2-3 weeks. Price: $14.95.</li>
	<li>EMS Courier Delivery. Its average shipping duration is 3-8 business days. Unfortunately, this shipping method is not available in several countries. If your country is in this list, you won't be able to choose EMS as a shipping type. Price: $24.95.</li>
</ul>
<p>You should also bear in mind some possible delays at customs we are not responsible for.  Therefore, why some parcels may  arrive a bit later or earlier than expected.</p>
<p>The orders are usually processed within 24 hours. As soon as your order is registered, you receive an automatic e-mail message. Sometimes, such notifications get into spam folders. Look for a notification there if you have not received one. We make every effort to deliver your parcels in time. </p>
<p>All the medications you can see on our site are usually on stock. If you have some problems with the delivery, we will try to solve it as soon as possible.  Our Customer Care Specialists are at your disposal and ready to connect  with  you any moment.</p>

<h1>Return policy</h1>
<p>If you received damaged or defective medication or the company shipped the incorrect product we will resend your order free of charge.</p>
<p>The quality of our products is beyond exception, but if you are not satisfied with it, contact our Customer Care Specialists.</p>
<p>In case that your pills are damaged, we will resend you a new package free of charge.</p>
<p>Be informed that the return of medications is strictly prohibited by International rules.</p>

<h1>Privacy policy</h1>
<p>We guarantee a complete  anonymity,  as well as the safety of your personal and financial information. You receive your parcel as a gift - without any  titles and prices on it - so that nobody could learn about its contents and you did not have to pay any customary fees. Names of the ordered products won't be reflected on the credit card statement.</p>
<p>We make use of numerous security measures to guarantee the security of your private information.</p>
<p>The checkout process utilises industry-standard SSL-based encryption that ensures the privacy and security of all your information.</p>
<p>Our preferable way of communication with our clients is e-mail. Though we do not call to our clients generally, we ask you to indicate your correct telephone number for the Address Verification System not to cancel your order.</p>
