Check the label on the medicine for exact dosing instructions.&nbsp;An extra patient leaflet is available with Aygestin. Talk to your pharmacist if you have questions about this information.<br />Take Aygestin by mouth with or without food.<br />Take Aygestin at the same time every day, with doses not more than 24 hours apart.<br />If you miss a dose of Aygestin, take it as soon as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.<br /><br />Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Aygestin.</p><p><strong>DOSAGE&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Therapy with Aygestin must be adapted to the specific indications and therapeutic response of the individual patient. This dosage schedule assumes the interval between menses to be 28 days.&nbsp;Secondary amenorrhea, abnormal uterine bleeding due to hormonal imbalance in the absence of organic pathology: 2.5 to 10 mg Aygestin (norethindrone) may be given daily for 5 to 10 days during the second half of the theoretical menstrual cycle to produce an optimum secretory transformation of an endometrium that has been adequately primed with either endogenous or exogenous estrogen.<br /><br />Progestin withdrawal bleeding usually occurs within three to seven days after discontinuing Aygestin (norethindrone) therapy. Patients with a past history of recurrent episodes of abnormal uterine bleeding may benefit from planned menstrual cycling with Aygestin (norethindrone) .<br /><br />Endometriosis: Initial daily dosage of 5 mg Aygestin (norethindrone) for two weeks. Dosage should be increased by 2.5 mg per day every two weeks until 15 mg per day of Aygestin (norethindrone) is reached. Therapy may be held at this level for six to nine months or until annoying breakthrough bleeding demands temporary termination.</p><p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p><p>Store Aygestin in a tightly closed container at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 and 25 degrees C). Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep Aygestin out of the reach of children and away from pets.</p><p><strong>MORE INFO:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Aygestin is a progestin hormone.
