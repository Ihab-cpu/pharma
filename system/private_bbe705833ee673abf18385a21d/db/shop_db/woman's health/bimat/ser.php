Bimat may increase the percent and duration of hairs in the growth phase, resulting in eyelash growth.</p><p><strong>Dosage and direction</strong></p><p>Remove make-up and contact lenses prior to application; ensure face is clean. Apply with the sterile applicator provided only; do not use other brushes or applicators. Use a tissue or cloth to blot any excess solution on the outside of the upper eyelid margin; do not apply to lower eyelash line. Do not reuse applicators; use new applicator for second eye. Applying more than once nightly will not increase eyelash growth; eyelash growth is expected to return to baseline when therapy is discontinued. May reinsert contacts 15 minutes after application.</p><p>May be used with other eye drops to lower intraocular pressure.
