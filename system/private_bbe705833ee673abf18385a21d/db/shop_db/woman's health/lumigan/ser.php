Hold the dropper above the eye with the tip down. Look up and away from the dropper as you squeeze out a drop, then close your eye.<br />Use only the number of drops prescribed by your doctor.<br />Gently press your finger to the inside corner of the eye (near your nose) for about 1 minute to keep the liquid from draining into your tear duct.<br />Also wait at least 5 minutes before using any other eye drops that your doctor has prescribed.</p><p><strong>Precautions</strong></p><p>You should not use this medication if you are allergic to bimatoprost.<br /><br />Before using bimatoprost, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have swelling or infection of your eye.</p><p>Do not use this medication while wearing contact lenses. Bimatoprost ophthalmic may contain a preservative that can discolor soft contact lenses. Wait at least 15 minutes after using bimatoprost before putting in your contact lenses.<br /><br />Lumigan may cause a gradual change in the color of your eyes or eyelids and lashes, as well as increased growth or thickness of your eyelashes. These color changes, usually an increase in brown pigment, occur slowly and you may not notice them for months or years. Color changes may be permanent even after your treatment ends, and may occur only in the eye being treated. This could result in a cosmetic difference in eye or eyelash color from one eye to the other.<br /><br />Do not allow the tip of the dropper to touch any surface, including your eyes or hands. If the dropper becomes contaminated it could cause an infection in your eye, which can lead to vision loss or serious damage to the eye.</p><p>FDA pregnancy category C.
