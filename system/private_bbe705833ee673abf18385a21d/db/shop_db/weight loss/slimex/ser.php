For the best results Slimex should be used in combination with a calorie controlled diet and a regular exercise routine. The intent of Slimex is to assist with moderate weight loss over 6 months (5-10%) - 9 months for diabetics - when used with a diet and exercise programme. This is in accordance with modern weight-loss practice, which emphasises that moderate weight loss achieves significant health improvement. Losing even modest amounts of weight (5-10% of your initial weight) and keeping it off has been found to reduce risks for diseases such as heart disease and diabetes.</p><p><strong>SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p><p><strong>Do NOT use Slimex if:</strong></p>
