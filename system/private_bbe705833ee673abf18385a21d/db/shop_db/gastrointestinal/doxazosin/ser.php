Doxazosin is an alpha-blocker. It works by relaxing muscles in the blood vessels, resulting in lowering of blood pressure. In men with BPH, alpha-blockers work by relaxing muscles around the urethra (the tube that drains urine from the bladder), which improves urinary symptoms.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Use Doxazosin as directed by your doctor.</p><ul><li>Take Doxazosin by mouth with or without food.</li><li>Doxazosin may cause a sudden drop in blood      pressure after the first dose. Take your first dose at bedtime. If you get      up during the night, sit up slowly, then stand slowly.</li><li>If you miss a dose of Doxazosin, take it as soon      as possible. If it is almost time for your next dose, skip the missed dose      and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.</li></ul><p>Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Doxazosin.</p><p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p><p>Store Doxazosin at 77 degrees F (25 degrees C). Brief storage at temperatures between 59 and 86 degrees F (15 and 30 degrees C) is permitted. Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep Doxazosin out of reach of children and away from pets.</p><p><strong>SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p><p><strong>Do NOT use Doxazosin if:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>you are allergic to any ingredient of      Doxazosin or to similar medicines (eg, prazosin).</li>
</ul>
<p>Some medical conditions may interact with Doxazosin. Tell your health care provider if you have any medical conditions, especially if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are pregnant, planning to become      pregnant, or are breast-feeding</li>
<li>if you are taking any prescription or      nonprescription medicine, herbal preparation, or dietary supplement</li>
<li>if you have allergies to medicines, foods,      or other substances</li>
<li>if you have a history of prostate cancer,      kidney or liver problems, or high or low blood pressure</li>
<li>if you will be having eye surgery.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors (eg,      sildenafil, vardenafil) because severe low blood pressure may occur</li>
<li>Clarithromycin, HIV protease inhibitors      (eg, ritonavir), itraconazole, ketoconazole, nefazodone, telithromycin, or      voriconazole because they may increase the risk of Doxazosin's side      effects.</li>

<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doxazosin may cause drowsiness, dizziness,      lightheadedness, or fainting. These effects may be worse if you take it      with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Doxazosin with caution. Do not      drive or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react      to it.</li>
<li>Doxazosin may cause a sudden drop in blood      pressure after the first dose. Take your first dose at bedtime. If you get      up during the night, sit up slowly, then stand slowly. This will help to      reduce your lightheadedness or dizziness. These effects will more likely      occur after the first few doses or if your dose has increased, but can      occur at any time while you are taking the medicine. It can also occur if      you stop taking the medicine and then restart treatment.</li>
<li>Doxazosin may cause dizziness,      lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may      increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly,      especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of      these effects.</li>
<li>Do NOT take more than the recommended dose      without checking with your doctor.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take      Doxazosin before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care,      or surgery (including eye surgery).</li>
<li>Doxazosin may rarely cause a prolonged,      painful erection. This could happen even when you are not having sex. If      this is not treated right away, it could lead to permanent sexual problems      such as impotence. Contact your doctor right away if this happens.</li>
<li>Patients who take medicine for high blood      pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting      treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel      "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new      symptoms.</li>
<li>Lab tests, including blood pressure, may      be performed while you use Doxazosin. These tests may be used to monitor      your condition or check for side effects. Be sure to keep all      doctor and lab appointments.</li>
<li>Use Doxazosin with caution in the elderly;      they may be more sensitive to its effects, especially low blood pressure.</li>
<li>Doxazosin should not be used in children;      safety and effectiveness in children have not been confirmed.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you      become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the      benefits and risks of using Doxazosin while you are pregnant. It is not      known if Doxazosin is found in breast milk. If you are or will be      breast-feeding while you use Doxazosin, check with your doctor. Discuss      any possible risks to your baby.</li>
