It can help men who have erectile dysfunction get and sustain an erection when they are sexually excited.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p><p>You should take the tablets through only the oral route with water. Ideally the medicine will take 30-50 minutes to reach the desired area of body as it dissolves in blood. It is always preferred to talk to doctor if you experience any side effects after consumption of this medicine or have chosen as self medication.</p><p>Caverta works when you take it almost an hour prior to the plans of becoming sexually active. The effects last for 4 hours and it begins its activity in a 30 minute period. The potential of this medication could go down as you consume meals high in fat, fried items or fast food.

If it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and take the medicine at your next regularly scheduled time. Do not take extra medicine to make up the missed dose.</p><p><strong>DOSAGE</strong></p><p>Dosage of the medication will vary as per your requirements. If your doctor detects larger dose is required it will be adjusted accordingly. You should remember the maximum dosage that can be taken is 100, only with prior consent with your physician.
