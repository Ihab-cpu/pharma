<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Trandate may cause drowsiness, dizziness,      or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol      or certain medicines. Use Trandate with caution. Do not drive or perform      other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.</li>
<li>Trandate may cause dizziness,      lightheadedness, or fainting; alcohol, hot weather, exercise, or fever may      increase these effects. To prevent them, sit up or stand slowly,      especially in the morning. Sit or lie down at the first sign of any of      these effects.</li>
<li>Patients who take medicine for high blood      pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting      treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel      "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new      symptoms.</li>
<li>Do not suddenly stop using Trandate      without first checking with your doctor. Suddenly stopping Trandate may      result in chest pain or temporary symptoms such as shaking, sweating,      headache, irregular heartbeat, and general unwell feeling. If your doctor      decides that you should stop using Trandate, your dosage should be reduced      over a period of 1 to 2 weeks and you should be carefully monitored.</li>

<li>If you have a history of any severe      allergic reaction, talk with your doctor. You may be at risk for an even      more severe allergic reaction if you come into contact with the substance      that caused your allergy. Some medicines used to treat severe allergies      may also not work as well while you are using Trandate.</li>
<li>Trandate may interfere with certain lab      tests. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are using Trandate.</li>
<li>If your doctor has instructed you to check      your blood pressure and heart rate regularly, be sure to do so.</li>

<li>Diabetes patients - Trandate may hide      signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid heartbeat. Be sure to watch for      other signs of low blood sugar. Low blood sugar may make you anxious,      sweaty, weak, dizzy, drowsy, or faint. It may also make your vision      change; give you a headache, chills, or tremors; or make you more hungry.      Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the      dose of your diabetes medicine.</li>
<li>Lab tests, including kidney and liver      function tests, may be performed while you use Trandate. These tests may      be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be      sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.</li>
