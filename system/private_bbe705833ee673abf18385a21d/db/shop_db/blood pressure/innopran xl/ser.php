<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>InnoPran XL may cause drowsiness,      dizziness, lightheadedness, or vision changes. These effects may be worse      if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use InnoPran XL with      caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you      know how you react to it.</li>
<li>Check with your doctor before you drink      alcohol while you are taking InnoPran XL; it may increase the risk of InnoPran      XL's side effects.</li>
<li>Do NOT take more than the recommended dose      without checking with your doctor.</li>
<li>Patients who take medicine for high blood      pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting      treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel      "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new      symptoms.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take InnoPran      XL before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or      surgery.</li>
<li>If you have a history of any severe      allergic reaction, talk with your doctor. You may be at risk of an even      more severe allergic reaction if you come into contact with the substance      that caused your allergy. Some medicines used to treat severe allergies      may also not work as well while you are using InnoPran XL.</li>
<li>InnoPran XL may lower your blood sugar      levels. This is most likely to happen in infants and children, or in      patients who have diabetes or kidney problems. It may also occur after      prolonged physical activity or during fasting. Low blood sugar may make      you anxious, sweaty, weak, dizzy, drowsy, or faint. It may also make your      heart beat faster; make your vision change; give you a headache, chills,      or tremors; or make you more hungry. If this is not available, you should      eat or drink a quick source of sugar like table sugar, honey, candy,      orange juice, or non-diet soda. This will raise your blood sugar level      quickly. Tell your doctor right away if this happens.</li>
<li>Diabetes patients - InnoPran XL may hide      signs of low blood sugar, such as a rapid heartbeat. Be sure to watch for      other signs of low blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your      doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.</li>
<li>InnoPran XL may interfere with certain lab      tests, including the glaucoma screening test and dobutamine stress      echocardiography. Be sure your doctor and lab personnel know you are taking      InnoPran XL.</li>
<li>Lab tests, including blood pressure and      heart function tests, may be performed while you use InnoPran XL. These      tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects. Be      sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.</li>
<li>Use InnoPran XL with caution in the elderly;      they may be more sensitive to its effects.</li>
<li>InnoPran XL should be used with extreme      caution in children; safety and effectiveness in children have not been      confirmed. Children may be more sensitive to InnoPran XL's effects,      especially low blood sugar levels or shortness of breath.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you      become pregnant, contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the      benefits and risks of using InnoPran XL while you are pregnant. InnoPran      XL is found in breast milk. If you are or will be breast-feeding while you      use InnoPran XL, check with your doctor. Discuss any possible risks to      your baby.</li>
