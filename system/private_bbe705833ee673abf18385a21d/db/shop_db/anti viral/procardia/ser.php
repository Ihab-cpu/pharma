Procardia is a calcium channel blocking agent. It works by interfering with the normal action of calcium in blood vessel constriction (relaxes the blood vessels) and heart muscle contraction (heart may beat with less force and pump out less blood) and nerve conduction in the heart (heart may beat more slowly and more regularly). Calcium channel blockers are used to dilate (widen) the arteries of the heart and other arteries (reduce angina chest pain and reduce elevated blood pressure), and stabilize the heart rhythm in conditions in which the heart is beating too fast or in an irregular rhythm (antiarrhythmic effects).</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Use Procardia as directed by your doctor.</p><ul><li>Take Procardia by mouth with or without food.</li><li>Do not eat grapefruit or drink grapefruit juice      while you use Procardia.</li><li>Swallow Procardia whole.
