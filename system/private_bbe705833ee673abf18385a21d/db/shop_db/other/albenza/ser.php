The loss of the cytoplasmic microtubules leads to impaired uptake of glucose by the larval and adult stages of the susceptible parasites, and depletes their glycogen stores. Degenerative changes in the endoplasmic reticulum, the mitochondria of the germinal layer, and the subsequent release of lysosomes result in decreased production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is the energy required for the survival of the helminth. Due to diminished energy production, the parasite is immobilized and eventually dies.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p><p>Before taking albendazole, tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to it; or to other benzimidazole anthelmintic drugs (e.g., mebendazole); or if you have any other allergies.
