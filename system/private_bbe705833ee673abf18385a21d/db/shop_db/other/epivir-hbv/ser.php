These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Epivir-HBV with caution. Do not drive or perform other possibly unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.<br />Your doctor will offer you counseling and testing for HIV infection (the virus that causes AIDS) before treatment with Epivir-HBV and periodically during treatment. You should not take Epivir-HBV if you have HIV infection. If you have both hepatitis B virus and HIV, make sure that your doctor knows you have both infections. If you are prescribed lamivudine, you should only use the medicine that is for HIV treatment ( Epivir). The lower dose of lamivudine in Epivir-HBV could make the HIV infection harder to treat.<br />Epivir-HBV is not a cure for hepatitis B virus infection. It is unknown if Epivir-HBV reduces the risk of liver cancer or cirrhosis that may be caused by hepatitis B virus. Some patients developed hepatitis B virus that is resistant to Epivir-HBV. These patients had less benefit from Epivir-HBV and some experienced worsening of hepatitis after the resistant virus appeared.<br />Your doctor will perform lab tests for several months after you stop taking Epivir-HBV. Some patients have had worsening hepatitis B virus after stopping use of Epivir-HBV. Tell your doctor about any new or unusual symptoms that you notice after stopping treatment.<br />Epivir-HBV has not been shown to reduce the risk of passing hepatitis B to other people through sexual contact or blood contamination. Use barrier forms of contraception (eg, condoms) if you are infected with hepatitis B virus.<br />Diabetes patients - Epivir-HBV contains sucrose and may affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely. Ask your doctor before you change the dose of your diabetes medicine.<br />Lab tests, including liver and kidney function tests, may be performed while you use Epivir-HBV. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for side effects.
