The daily dose should be increased every 2 weeks by increments of 14 mg/kg to the recommended daily dose of 42 mg/kg (21 mg/kg twice daily). In the clinical trial, the mean daily dose was 35 mg/kg in this age group. The effectiveness of lower doses has not been studied.</p><ul><li>6 Months To &lt; 4 Years</li></ul><p>Treatment should be initiated with a daily dose of 20 mg/kg in 2 divided doses (10 mg/kg twice daily).

Additional dosing increments may be given (1000 mg/day additional every 2 weeks) to a maximum recommended daily dose of 3000 mg.
