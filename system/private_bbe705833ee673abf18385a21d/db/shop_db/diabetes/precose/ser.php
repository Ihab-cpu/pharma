Acarbose is sometimes used in combination with insulin or other diabetes medications you take by mouth.<br /><br />Precose may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p><p>Take exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Do not take in larger or smaller amounts or for longer than recommended. Follow the directions on your prescription label.<br />Take precose (acarbose) with the first bite of a main meal, unless your doctor tells you otherwise.&nbsp;<br /><br />Your blood sugar will need to be checked often, and you may need other blood tests at your doctor's office. Visit your doctor regularly.<br /> If you take acarbose with insulin or other diabetes medications, your blood sugar could get too low. Low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) can occur if you skip a meal, exercise too long, drink alcohol, or are under stress.

Sugar sources include orange juice, glucose gel, candy, or milk. If you have severe hypoglycemia and cannot eat or drink, use an injection of glucagon. Your doctor can give you a prescription for a glucagon emergency injection kit and tell you how to give the injection. Be sure your family and close friends know how to help you in an emergency.<br /><br />Check your blood sugar carefully during a time of stress or illness, if you travel, exercise more than usual, drink alcohol, or skip meals.
