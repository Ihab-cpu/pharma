Glyset may be used alone, in combination with other oral diabetes medicines, or with insulin.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong></p><p>Use Glyset as directed by your doctor. Check the label on the medicine for exact dosing instructions.<br />Take Glyset with the first bite of each main meal, unless directed otherwise by your doctor.<br />If you are also taking charcoal or digestive enzyme preparations with Glyset, space them at least 2 to 4 hours apart for maximum effectiveness.<br />Carefully follow the diet and exercise program given to you by your health care provider.<br />Temporary insulin therapy may be necessary during stressful periods (such as fever, trauma, infection, or surgery).<br />If you miss a dose of Glyset, skip the missed dose and go back to your regular dosing schedule. Do not take 2 doses at once.<br /><br />Ask your health care provider any questions you may have about how to use Glyset.</p><p><strong>DOSAGE</strong></p><p>The recommended starting dosage of Glyset is 25 mg, given orally three times daily at the start (with the first bite) of each main meal. However, some patients may benefit by starting at 25 mg once daily to minimize gastrointestinal adverse effects, and gradually increasing the frequency of administration to 3 times daily.</p><p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p><p>Store Glyset at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 and 25 degrees C). Store away from heat, moisture, and light. Do not store in the bathroom. Keep in a tight, light-resistant container. Keep Glyset out of the reach of children and away from pets.</p><p><strong>SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p><p>Notify your dentist or doctor that you are taking Glyset before you have any dental work or surgery.<br />Carefully follow the regular testing of urine or blood glucose schedules given to you by your health care provider.<br />Glyset, used with other diabetes medicines, may cause a loss of blood sugar control. Your health care provider may need to change the amount of medicine that you are taking. Because Glyset prevents the breakdown of table (cane) sugar, be sure to use glucose (dextrose), not sugar or fruits, to treat symptoms of low blood sugar (tiredness, excessive hunger and sweating, numbness in arms or legs). Contact your health care provider if these symptoms occur.<br />LAB TESTS, including blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin levels, may be performed to monitor your progress and to check for side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.<br />Use Glyset with extreme caution in CHILDREN. Safety and effectiveness have not been confirmed.<br />PREGNANCY and BREAST-FEEDING: If you become pregnant while taking Glyset, discuss with your doctor the benefits and risks of using Glyset during pregnancy. Glyset is excreted in breast milk. Do not breast feed while taking Glyset.</p><p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS</strong></p><p>All medicines may cause side effects, but many people have no, or minor, side effects.
