<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Altace may cause dizziness,      lightheadedness, or fainting. These effects may be worse if you take it      with alcohol or certain medicines. Use Altace with caution. Do not drive      or perform other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.</li>

<li>Altace may cause a serious side effect      called angioedema. Contact your doctor at once if you develop swelling of      the hands, face, lips, eyes, throat, or tongue; difficulty swallowing or      breathing; or hoarseness.</li>

<li>Patients who take medicine for high blood      pressure often feel tired or run down for a few weeks after starting      treatment. Be sure to take your medicine even if you may not feel      "normal." Tell your doctor if you develop any new      symptoms.</li>
<li>If you have high blood pressure, do not      use nonprescription products that contain stimulants. These products may      include diet pills or cold medicines. Contact your doctor if you have any      questions or concerns.</li>
