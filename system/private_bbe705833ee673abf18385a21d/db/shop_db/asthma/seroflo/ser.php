Check the label on the medicine for exact dosing instructions.<br /> Seroflo Inhaler comes with an extra patient information sheet called a Medication Guide. Read it carefully. Read it again each time you get Seroflo Inhaler refilled. Do not use a spacer with Seroflo Inhaler. <br /> Always ready and use this device in a level, flat position. <br /> Hold the device in one hand and put the thumb of your other hand on the thumb grip. Push your thumb away from you as far as it will go until the mouthpiece appears and snaps into position. <br /> Hold the device in a level, flat position with the mouthpiece toward you. Slide the lever away from you as far as it will go until it clicks. <br /> Do NOT close or tilt the device, play with the lever, or move the lever more than 1 time. This may release or waste extra doses. <br /> Hold the device away from your mouth and breathe out fully. Do NOT breathe into the inhaler. Put the mouthpiece to your lips. Breathe in quickly and deeply through the device. <br /> Remove the device from your mouth. Hold your breath for about 10 seconds, or as long as is comfortable. Then breathe out slowly. <br /> Close the device. Put your thumb on the thumb grip and slide it back toward you as far as it will go. The device will click shut and the lever will return to its original position. <br /> Rinse your mouth with water after using Seroflo Inhaler. DO NOT swallow the rinse solution. Spit the rinse water out. <br /> If you are using other inhaled medicines, wait a few minutes between using Seroflo Inhaler and other inhalers, unless directed otherwise by your doctor. <br /> Take your doses of Seroflo Inhaler about 12 hours apart, unless your doctor tells you otherwise. <br /> Never wash the mouthpiece or any other part of the inhaler. Keep it dry. Store Seroflo Inhaler in a dry place. <br /> Throw Seroflo Inhaler away 1 month after you remove it from the foil pouch, or after the dose indicator reads "0," whichever comes first. <br /> You may breathe more easily after the first dose of Seroflo Inhaler. However, it may take 1 week or longer to achieve the most benefit. <br />Use Seroflo Inhaler on a regular schedule to get the most benefit from it. Using Seroflo Inhaler at the same times each day will help you remember to use it. Do not stop using Seroflo Inhaler even if you feel better unless your doctor tells you to.<strong></strong></p><p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p><p>Store Seroflo Inhaler at room temperature, between 68 and 77 degrees F (20 and 25 degrees C), in a dry place.
