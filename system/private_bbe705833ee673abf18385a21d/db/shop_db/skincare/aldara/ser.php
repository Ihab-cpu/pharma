Aldara is used to treat actinic keratosis (a condition caused  by too much sun exposure) on the face and scalp.</p><p>Aldara (for the skin) is also used to treat a minor form of skin  cancer called superficial basal cell carcinoma, when surgery would not  be an appropriate treatment.</p><p>Aldara also treats genital warts that appear on the outside of the  body, but this medicine is not a cure for genital warts. Imiquimod may  be used in adults and children who are at least 12 years.</p><p>Aldara may also be used for purposes not listed in this medication guide.</p><p><strong>INSTRUCTIONS&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Use Aldara as directed by your doctor.</p><ul><li>Before applying Aldara, wash your hands and wash the skin area to be  treated. Allow the skin to dry for at least 10 minutes before applying  the medicine. Always wash your hands after applying the medicine also.  Do not use Aldara on areas of broken, wounded, or burned skin. Wait  until these conditions have healed before using Aldara.</li></ul><ul><li>Aldara is normally used 2 to 5 times per week for up to 16 weeks. How  you use this medication will depend on the condition you are treating.  Follow your doctor's instructions.</li><li>If you miss a dose, skip the missed dose and wait until the next time you are getting ready  for bed to use the medicine. Do not use extra medicine to make up the  missed dose.</li></ul><p><strong>STORAGE</strong></p><p>Store Aldara at room temperature away from moisture and heat. Do not  freeze. Keep each packet unopened until you are ready to use it.</p><p><strong>SAFETY INFORMATION</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Do NOT use&nbsp;Aldara if you have any of these or other conditions:</p>
<ul style="text-align: justify;">
<li>
<p>sunburn or other skin problems;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a weak immune system or autoimmune disorder;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>graft-versus-host disease;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if you have recently been treated for actinic keratosis or genital warts with surgery or other medications; or</p>
</li>
<li>

</li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid getting Aldara in your eyes, mouth, and nose, or on your lips.  Do not place the cream in your rectum, vagina, or urethra. If it does  get into any of these areas, rinse with water. Do not use Aldara on  sunburned, windburned, dry, chapped, irritated, or broken skin.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid using other medications on the areas you treat with Aldara unless your doctor tells you to.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid exposure to sunlight or tanning beds. Aldara can make you  sunburn more easily. Wear protective clothing and use sunscreen (SPF 30  or higher) when you are outdoors.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Avoid having unprotected sex. Imiquimod is not a cure for genital  warts, and it will not protect against sexually transmitted diseases  such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis.  Talk with your doctor about safe ways to prevent transmission during  sex.</p><p><strong>SIDE EFFECTS</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Get emergency medical help if you have any of these signs of an  allergic reaction to Aldara: hives; difficulty breathing; swelling of  your face, lips, tongue, or throat. Wash off the medicine and call your  doctor at once if you have a serious skin reaction such as severe  itching, burning, oozing, bleeding, or skin changes where the medicine  is applied.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Stop using Aldara and call your doctor at once if you have a serious  side effect such as flu symptoms such as fever, chills, body aches,  tired feeling, swollen glands. When treating genital warts around the  vagina, if you have severe swelling or urination problems, stop using  Aldara and call your doctor right away.</p>";s:13:"full_descr_de";s:0:"";s:13:"full_descr_fr";s:0:"";s:13:"full_descr_es";s:0:"";s:13:"full_descr_it";s:0:"";s:9:"min_price";s:9:"23.586948";s:9:"pack_name";s:6:"creams";s:4:"type";s:7:"percent";s:7:"analogs";a:0:{}s:8:"synonims";a:1:{i:0;s:17:"Imiquimod topical";}s:18:"active_ingredients";N;s:8:"packings";a:1:{i:5;a:10:{i:6880;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6880";s:5:"count";s:1:"1";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:7:"35.2044";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6881;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6881";s:5:"count";s:1:"2";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"28.75026";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6882;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6882";s:5:"count";s:1:"3";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"26.59888";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6883;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6883";s:5:"count";s:1:"4";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"25.52319";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6884;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6884";s:5:"count";s:1:"5";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"24.87778";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6885;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6885";s:5:"count";s:1:"6";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:7:"24.4475";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6886;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6886";s:5:"count";s:1:"7";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"24.14016";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6887;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6887";s:5:"count";s:1:"8";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"23.90966";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6888;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6888";s:5:"count";s:1:"9";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"23.73037";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}i:6889;a:5:{s:10:"id_packing";s:4:"6889";s:5:"count";s:2:"10";s:6:"dosage";d:5;s:14:"price_per_pill";s:8:"23.58695";s:4:"name";s:6:"Aldara";}}}}
