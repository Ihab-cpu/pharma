<ul>
<li>Omnicef may cause drowsiness or dizziness.      These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol or certain      medicines. Use Omnicef with caution. Do not drive or perform other      possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.</li>

<li>If you are taking Omnicef and a product      that contains iron, your stools may turn a reddish color. This is      normal and not a cause for concern.</li>
