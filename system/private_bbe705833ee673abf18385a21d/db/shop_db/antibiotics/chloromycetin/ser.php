<ul>
<li>you are allergic to any ingredient in Chloromycetin</li>
<li>you have previously had serious side      effects from Chloromycetin</li>
<li>you have a low white or red blood cell      count or decreased blood platelets</li>
<li>you have a minor infection such as a cold,      flu, throat infection, or you are using Chloromycetin to prevent a      bacterial infection</li>
<li>you are taking other medicines that may      decrease your bone marrow (eg, cancer chemotherapy); check with your      doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if any of your other medicines may decrease      your bone marrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>Contact your doctor or health care provider right away if any of these apply to you.</p>
<p>Some medical conditions may interact with Chloromycetin. Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you have any medical conditions, especially if any of the following apply to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>if you are pregnant, planning to become      pregnant, or are breast-feeding</li>
<li>if you are taking any prescription or      nonprescription medicine, herbal preparation, or dietary supplement</li>
<li>if you have allergies to medicines, foods,      or other substances</li>
<li>if you have anemia, bone marrow problems,      liver disease, or kidney problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some medicines may interact with Chloromycetin. Tell your health care provider if you are taking any other medicines, especially any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Anticoagulants (eg, warfarin) because side      effects, including risk of bleeding, may be increased</li>
<li>Hydantoins (eg, phenytoin) or      sulfonylureas (eg, glyburide) because the actions and side effects of      these medicines may be increased.</li>
<li>Medicines that may decrease your bone marrow      (eg, cancer chemotherapy ) because the risk of serious side effects, such      as low blood platelet levels and low white blood cell counts, may be      increased; check with your doctor or pharmacist if you are unsure if any      of your medicines may decrease your bone marrow.</li>
</ul>
<p>This may not be a complete list of all interactions that may occur. Ask your health care provider if Chloromycetin may interact with other medicines that you take. Check with your health care provider before you start, stop, or change the dose of any medicine.</p>
<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do not exceed the recommended dose or use Chloromycetin      for longer than prescribed without checking with your doctor.</li>
<li>Chloromycetin is effective only against      bacteria. It is not effective for treating viral infections (eg, the      common cold).</li>
<li>It is important to use Chloromycetin for      the full course of treatment. Failure to do so may decrease the      effectiveness of Chloromycetin and increase the risk that the bacteria      will no longer be sensitive to Chloromycetin and will not be able to be      treated by this or certain other antibiotics in the future.</li>
<li>Long-term or repeated use of Chloromycetin      may cause a second infection. Your doctor may want to change your medicine      to treat the second infection. Contact your doctor if signs of a second      infection occur.</li>
<li>If symptoms of "gray syndrome"      (swelling of the abdomen, pale or blue skin color, vomiting, shock,      difficulty breathing, refusal to suck, loose green stools, limp muscles,      low temperature) occur in a newborn or infant, contact your doctor. Death      may occur within hours of the onset of symptoms. Stopping use of Chloromycetin      when symptoms first appear increases the chance for a complete recovery.</li>
<li>Chloromycetin may lower your body's      ability to fight infection. Prevent infection by avoiding contact with      people with colds or other infections. Notify your doctor of any signs of      infection, including fever, sore throat, rash, or chills.</li>
<li>Chloromycetin may reduce the number of      clot-forming cells (platelets) in your blood. To prevent bleeding, avoid      situations in which bruising or injury may occur. Report any unusual      bleeding, bruising, blood in stools, or dark, tarry stools to your doctor.</li>
<li>Diabetes patients - Chloromycetin may      affect your blood sugar. Check blood sugar levels closely and ask your      doctor before adjusting the dose of your diabetes medicine.</li>
<li>Lab tests, including complete blood cell      counts, may be performed to monitor your progress or check for side      effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.</li>
<li>Use Chloromycetin with extreme caution in children      younger 1 year. Safety and effectiveness in this age group      have not been confirmed.</li>
<li>Use Chloromycetin with extreme caution in children      younger 10 years who have diarrhea or a stomach or bowel infection.</li>
<li>Use Chloromycetin with extreme caution in      premature and full-term infants because they may be more sensitive to the      effects of Chloromycetin, especially the risk of "gray      syndrome."</li>
<li>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: If you      become pregnant while taking Chloromycetin, discuss with your doctor the      benefits and risks of using Chloromycetin during pregnancy. Chloromycetin      should be used with extreme caution during full-term pregnancy and labor      because the fetus may experience severe side effects. Chloromycetin is      excreted in breast milk. Do not breastfeed while taking Chloromycetin.</li>
