<p><strong>Important safety information:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Minocin may cause drowsiness, dizziness,      or lightheadedness. These effects may be worse if you take it with alcohol      or certain medicines. Use Minocin with caution. Do not drive or perform      other possible unsafe tasks until you know how you react to it.</li>
<li>Minocin may cause you to become sunburned      more easily. Avoid the sun, sunlamps, or tanning booths until you know how      you react to Minocin. Use a sunscreen or wear protective clothing if you      must be outside for more than a short time.</li>
<li>Long-term or repeated use of Minocin may      cause a second infection. Tell your doctor if signs of a second infection      occur. Your medicine may need to be changed to treat this.</li>
<li>Minocin only works against bacteria; it      does not treat viral infections (eg, the common cold).</li>
<li>Mild diarrhea is common with antibiotic      use. However, a more serious form of diarrhea (pseudomembranous colitis)      may rarely occur. This may develop while you use the antibiotic or within      several months after you stop using it. Contact your doctor right away if      stomach pain or cramps, severe diarrhea, or bloody stools occur. Do not      treat diarrhea without first checking with your doctor.</li>
<li>Tell your doctor or dentist that you take      Minocin before you receive any medical or dental care, emergency care, or      surgery.</li>
<li>Be sure to use Minocin for the full course      of treatment. If you do not, the medicine may not clear up your infection      completely. The bacteria could also become less sensitive to this or other      medicines. This could make the infection harder to treat in the future.</li>
<li>Hormonal birth control (eg, birth control      pills) may not work as well while you are using Minocin. To prevent      pregnancy, use an extra form of birth control (eg, condoms).</li>
<li>Lab tests may be performed while you use      Minocin. These tests may be used to monitor your condition or check for      side effects. Be sure to keep all doctor and lab appointments.</li>
<li>Use Minocin with caution in the elderly;      they may be more sensitive to its effects.</li>
<li>Use Minocin with extreme caution in children      younger 10 years who have diarrhea or an infection of the stomach      or bowel.</li>
<li>Minocin should not be used in children younger      than 8 years old; safety and effectiveness in these children have not been      confirmed. Using Minocin in children younger than 8 years old or in women      during the last half of pregnancy may cause a permanent change in the      tooth coloring of the child.</li>
<li>Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Minocin has      been shown to cause harm to the fetus. If you think you may be pregnant,      contact your doctor. You will need to discuss the benefits and risks of      using Minocin while you are pregnant. Minocin is found in breast milk. Do      not breastfeed while taking Minocin.</li>
