            Our pharmacy sells generic and brand name medicine. One can easily tell the difference between these types of medication on our site. Brand name products are marked with the word &apos;brand&apos; in their names. Generic medications don&apos;t have this mark in their names. The offered medication is of high quality.

            <p>A generic medication is an exact copy of a brand-name medicine. It has the same route of administration, dosage, intended use, side effects, safety and strength (even if a pill has a different shape or color). A generic drug simply means that the drug is not made by the original manufacturer, the chemical is exactly the same. To put it differently generics have identical active ingredients and their pharmacological effects are the same (as those of their brand-name equivalents). Thus a generic drug is not worse than brand medicine.</p>
            <p>Example: A generic version of Glucophage is metformin.</p>
            <p>A lot of people erroneously believe that generic medications need more time to work. This is not true. Generics work as effectively and quick as the brand-name analoques (according to FDA requirements). Therefore the speed of absorption of active ingredients does not differ. The difference that one can find between a brand medication and a generic lies in the name, shape and price. The original manufacturer uses a brand name whereas a generic drug is usually called by the name of the active ingredient. The matter is that a manufacturer can not possess a patent for a certain chemical agent, this is why different manufacturers of generic drugs are able to produce the so-called generics legally.</p>

            '<p>A lot of people choose generics because a lot of money is spent by the manufacturers of brand-name drugs to advertise their products. Thus the manufacturer convinces the consumers of the necessity to buy his/her product. A generic drug manufacturer spends less money on product development and advertising. What is more: A generic analogue for the same medication creates competition. This fact helps to  reduce the price (Taken from: US Food and Drug Administration).</p>'

            'How the cheap price of a generic medication can be explained?',
            '
            	<p>A lot of  people are somehow concerned because generics are usually less expensive than their brand analogues. The quality and effectiveness is open to question. We assure you that there is nothing to worry about.  One of the most strict requirements of The Food and Drug Administration is safety/effectiveness.</p>
            	<p>A generic drud manufacturer does not spend money on marketing and development of his/her products. That is why a generic medication is cheaper.  A lot of substantial money is spent by the original manufacturer on research/development, marketing and promotion. It is important that a patent is granted when a manufacturer presents a new product. It gives the company an exclusive right to sell this medication (as long as the patent is valid).</p>
            	<p>As soon as the patent expires, a manufacturer can appeal to the FDA to gain the permission to produce/sell generic versions of the drug. Different entrepreneurs can afford producing and selling the medication cheaper because they don&apos;t need to take into account the start-up costs for development of the drug. The price can be lowered because of the competition among multiple companies begin producing and selling a medication.</p>
            	<p>We hope that the common misbelief that a generic medication is inferior in quality to brand analogues  and is manufactured in poor quality facilities is ruined. The Food and Drug Administration requires the same standards for all drugs, that is the reason why many companies produce both -  brands and generics.</p>
