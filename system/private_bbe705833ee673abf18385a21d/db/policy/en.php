            <p>Generic drugs are copies of brand-name drugs that have exactly the same dosage, intended use, effects, side effects, route of administration, safety and strength as the original drug. The properties of generic drugs don’t differ from its brand name counterparts, even if they have different shape or color. In other words generic drugs have identical active ingredients and their pharmacological effects are exactly the same as those of their brand-name equivalents. That is why generic medication is not worse than brand medication.</p>
            <p>One of the famous examples of a generic drug is metformin used for diabetes. A brand name for metformin is Glucophage.</p>
            <p>Another common misbelief is that generic drugs take more time to work. The FDA requires that generic drugs work as fast and effectively as the original brand-name products. That is why the speed of absorption of active ingredients is the same. The difference between a brand name medication and a generic consists in the name, shape and price.The matter is that s generic drug is usually called by the name of the active ingredient while a manufacturer uses a brand name.However, a manufacturer cannot possess a patent for a certain chemical agent, this is why various manufacturers of generic medications can legally produce the so-called generics.</p>

            'Why are generic drugs so cheap?',
            '
            	<p>Many people become concerned because generic drugs are often substantially less expensive than the brand-name versions. They wonder whether the quality and effectiveness have been compromised to make products less expensive. There is nothing to worry about because the Food and Drug Administration requires all generic drugs to be as safe and effective as brand-name drugs.</p>
            	<p>It is important to take into consideration the fact that generic medications are cheaper because the manufacturers did not spend money on marketing and development. Amanufacturerspends substantial money on research, development, marketing and promotion while introducing a new product on the market. What is more, a patent is granted that gives the company that developed the drug an exclusive right to sell this particular drug as long as the patent is valid.</p>
            	<p>When the patent nears expiration, manufacturers can appeal to the FDA to obtain the permission to produce and sell generic versions of the drug.Other companies can afford making and selling the drugcheaperand without the startup costs for development of the drug. The competition amongmultiple companies that start producing and selling a drug can also reduce the price.</p>
            	<p>Therefore we would like to dispelthe myth that generic medications are produced in poor quality facilities or are inferior in quality to brand-name medicines. The Food and Drug Administration applies the same standards for all medications, that is why many companies produce both brand and generic medicines. No wonder that 50% of generic drug production is implemented by brand-name companies (according to the FDA estimates).</p>
